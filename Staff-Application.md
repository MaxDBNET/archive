## Introduction

Before I go into details, I'd like to say this is not for the weak hearted. Staff positions require dedications and the will to take actions when deemed necessary. Without further ado, let's get started on how to apply for staff positions.

## Requirements
 - The ability to act mature when needed, *cough* Groovy *cough*.
 - As long as you're somewhat intelligent, matching Matt or exceeding, you made this requirement
 - Dedication, this is a must. I removed so many futile admins due to inactivity. If you're inactive, expect to be removed
 - If accepted, you're subjected go through a trial period and will be monitored for your actions

## How to Apply

If you match all the requirements mentioned above, you're able to request a staff position on our [servers](https://maxdb.net/servers)!

Just copy, fill and post using this application template   

### Note you must post your application under `Meta` with `Application` as the sub-category.

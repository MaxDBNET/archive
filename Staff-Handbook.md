## Banning

### Ban Format

This is the format you should follow when banning:

`BanReason | BanTime | Appeal at MaxDB.NET`

To use custom reason, simply go to the next page on the ban menu, accessible via `!admin`.

### Ban Time

Aside from the several fixed length stated in the punishment column, this is really up to the person that's banning. Generally, I base this off on % of players affected by this action.

So team killing, which only affects the minority of the players, will receive two days ban. But for stat boosting, this affects everyone; I'd do a week ban.

## Commands

Most if not all the admin's command can be accessed using `/admin`.

We also use `Ticketron` for reports, you can learn more about that [here](https://rumblefrog.github.io/Ticketron/).

## Sarah Bot

Sarah-bot is what we created to help optimize our workflow.
